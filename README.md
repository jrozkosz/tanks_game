# tanks_game
Desktop game for two players. Each player controls their tank. Users see the game for the bird's eye. <br />
Player 1: arrows for steering + 'space' for firing a bullet <br />
Player 2: 'wsad' for steering + 'q' for firing a bullet <br />
Only 5 bullets can be fired in a row - then there is few seconds of reloading. <br />
The field where players can move is restricted by window borders. <br />
If a bullet of one player hits other player's tank it's game over.
